# CSS Layout Challenge

We're building this layout by [ImranüèÄ on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/10747116-Cloud-Web-App):

[Sign up for the challenge here](https://daveceddia.com/css-layout-challenge/) and work through building the solution (get as far as you can) by Wednesday 3/25, and on Wednesday I'll do a livestream working through it together.

This repo will have a solution posted once the challenge is over, and a link to the livestream.

We're using [**Issues**](issues) on this repo as our little community forum. Post progress and questions there!
